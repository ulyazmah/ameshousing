# Ameshousing
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis practice on Ames Housing dataset.

## Introduction
This project uses the Ames housing data available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset) which includes 81 features describing a wide range of characteristics of 2,930 houses in Ames, Iowa sold between 2006 and 2010. 

## Purpose
How to predict the price of a house? Is the size of the garage in a house more important than the number of bathrooms? Does the year the house was built affect the quality and price of a house?  
With this project, we explore the dataset to give us a better understanding of the features, which is later used to predict the price of Ames Housing.
